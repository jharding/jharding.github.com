### [Philanthropist](/philanthropist)
Philanthropist is a browser extension that makes it easy to direct a portion of the money you spend on Amazon to your favorite projects. If you're a fan of a project that's a member of the Amazon Associates program, you can easily configure Philanthropist to make sure anytime you're browsing Amazon, your session is associated with that project.
