## Projects

### [Philanthropist](/philanthropist)
Philanthropist is a browser extension that makes it easy to direct a portion of the money you spend on Amazon to your favorite projects. If you're a fan of a project that's a member of the Amazon Associates program, you can easily configure Philanthropist to make sure anytime you're browsing Amazon, your session is associated with that project.

### [Webterm](https://github.com/jharding/webterm)
Webterm is an extensible terminal that can be included in web applications. It provides an interface for advanced users to use advanced features of whatever application it is included in. Webterm is a work in progress and I'm not sure when it'll be finished. 

### [Random Projects](https://github.com/jharding)
I have some random projects on GitHub that are either too minor to mention or are no longer being maintained. If you're interested, check out my GitHub profile and browse through some of them.
