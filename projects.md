Projects
========

### [Pharos](http://pharosapp.com)
Pharos is an iPhone app for quickly saving your current geographic location so you can find your way back. It's available in the App Store (or "Available on the App Store" if you're Apple) for free. 

### [Philanthropist](/philanthropist)
Philanthropist is a browser extension that makes it easy to direct a portion of the money you spend on Amazon to your favorite projects. If you're a fan of a project that's a member of the Amazon Associates program, you can easily configure Philanthropist to make sure anytime you're browsing Amazon, your session is associated with that project.

### [Photographer.js](https://github.com/jharding/photographer.js)
Photographer.js is a JavaScript library for capturing photos with webcams. It uses the WebRTC API so Flash isn't necessary. Pretty much only bleeding-edge browsers support the WebRTC API right now, so you'll need to use one of them if you're interested in playing around with this library.

### [Random Projects](https://github.com/jharding)
I have some random projects on GitHub that are either too minor to mention or are no longer being maintained. If you're interested, check out my GitHub profile and browse through some of them.
