It's been a while since I've had a personal site or a blog. I built one about 4 years ago when I still did most of my development on a LAMP stack, but I forgot to renew my domain (jakeharding.com is due to expire in August, I shall reclaim it!) and after that I decided it just wasn't worth it to maintain a personal site. The times have changed though and with my new interests, having somewhere to write about my projects and share my experiences is a must.

When I decided to build a personal site a few weeks back, I knew right away I wanted it to be static. I hate complexity and wanted to keep this site as simple as possible. That meant no WordPress or any other traditional CMS. I decided to build this site using a static site generator and initially I was leaning towards using [Blacksmith](http://blacksmith.jit.su/all-pages). However, after reading up on the different static site generators available, [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) stood out as the best option for me. It was a very mature project and being able to host my site for free on GitHub was a big plus.

Following the [GitHub Pages Documentation](http://help.github.com/pages/), I created [jharding.github.com](https://github.com/jharding/jharding.github.com) and used [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) to give my some boilerplate code to work with. I quickly figured out that Jekyll was simple enough to the point where I didn't need to any boilerplate code, so I ditched Jekyll Bootstrap and started from scratch.

After ditching the boilerplate code, it only took me about 12 hours to design and implement the entire site. I used [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for my baseline styles, but I made sure I added enough personal touch so that it didn't look like a generic Bootstrap site. Too many sites I see nowadays just use the default styling provided by Bootstrap and they don't do anything to separate themselves from the pack (If you're going to use the navbar, at least change the colors.). Needless to say I can't stand those sites. I think I actually prefer the days before Bootstrap where, while there were a lot of ugly sites, at least they were unique.

Whenever I'm working on a project, choosing colors is usually the part I struggle with the most somehow. Luckily, a few months back I ran across a neat little utility named [RYB](http://afriggeri.github.com/RYB/) on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/). Using RYB, I was able to generate a whole bunch of unique colors and then I picked the ones that stood out to me. Most likely, I'll play with the colors on and off for the foreseeable future, but I'm happy with the initial colors I've chosen. 

All-in-all I'm pretty happy with how the site turned out. I'll definitely be tweaking the site over the next few weeks, but even so, this initial version has exceeded my (albeit low) expectations. It'll be a good home for my random musings and will hopefully lead to some exposure for my projects. I have a few ideas for blog posts that I'll write over the upcoming months and while they might not be front page of Hacker News worthy, they should be interesting nonetheless. Stay tuned.
