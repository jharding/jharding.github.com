description: Christening my new site with a first post. This probably isn't worth your time to read, wait until the next post.

It's been a while since I've had a personal site or a blog. I built one about 4 years ago when I still did most of my development on a LAMP stack, but I forgot to renew my domain (jakeharding.com is due to expire in August, I shall reclaim it!) and after that I decided I didn't care enough to actually maintain a personal site. The times have changed though and with my new interests, having somewhere to write about my projects and share my experiences is a must.

When I decided to build a personal site a few weeks back, I knew right away I wanted it to be static. I hate complexity and wanted to keep this site as simple as possible. That meant no WordPress or any other traditional content management systems. Initially, I wanted to use a static site generator from the Node.js ecosystem, but in the end I decided the easiest solution was to use [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and host my site on GitHub. It also didn't hurt that this was the cheapest solution as hosting on GitHub is free. 

Following the [GitHub Pages Documentation](http://help.github.com/pages/), I created [jharding.github.com](https://github.com/jharding/jharding.github.com) and used [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) to give my some boilerplate code to work with. I quickly figured out that Jekyll was simple enough to point where I didn't need to any boilerplate code, so I ditched Jekyll Bootstrap and started from scratch.

After ditching the boilerplate code, it only took me about 12 hours to design and implement the entire site. For the most part, the site is all HTML and CSS. The only JavaScript used is  the JS needed for analytics and the few lines of JS bundled with the Twitter follow button. All-in-all I'm pretty happy with how the site turned out. It'll be a good home for my random musings and will hopefully lead to some my exposure for my projects.
