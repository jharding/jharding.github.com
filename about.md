## About Me 

My name is Jake Harding and I'm a software developer. Most of my work revolves around web applications and while I'd like to think I'm language agnostic, most of my projects are of the JavaScript variety. I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2010 with a B.S.E in computer science. I currently live in San Jose, CA and work at Twitter.
